You are building a video annotation system for speed control on electric scooters based on video streams. Key functionality includes synchronizing speed data, button events, and video, manually annotating potential errors, editing speed intervals, and highlighting moments where the machine learning model mispredicts. The backend is Python-based (FastAPI, Docker, Nginx), with data stored on Yandex Cloud S3. The system integrates a pre-existing inference model for error identification. The frontend uses React.js for video display, editing, and synchronizing data visualization. You require support for local annotation storage on the frontend, synced later with the backend, and you emphasize version control and user tracking for each annotation.
